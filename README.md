Hive is a system tailored to my personal needs. It consists of a web application that connects my devices (Windows, Linux, Android) via daemons. It uses its own protocol based on UDP and TCP for communication.

A simple dashboard can be used to control smart home devices connected to a Raspberry Pi with MQTT, Zigbee and Bluetooth. It can also be accessed via an Android widget and a watch face for Wear OS.

## Chatbot
The chatbot can be used for general use or to take advantage of some of Hive's features, such as controlling smart home devices or making the phone ring. On Android devices, the chatbot can be quickly accessed via voice input.

## Compress
Files and folders from different devices can be compressed and merged into a single zip file that is stored in the cloud. This enables simple backup automation.
